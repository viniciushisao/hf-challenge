## Known

1. This will only work while my personal token to the json file is valid. It must be changed to the actual file. 
1. There is no secure layer implemented. It would be good to sign in first. I did a class called WebSession that could handle it, but once again it is not implemented.
1. When tap to favorite or give a rate, it will ask for a login, which is validating the data but not commited in the web.
1. Mainly I used to libraries to make the code:
  1. Picaso to render images. I know it could be used another way since its just one image and it is not working, but I believe if it is going to be real implemented, I will use it more.
  1. Retrofit to handle server calls. Usually in my projects, when needed, I used to make all the calls manually, which is not painfull but ir requires more work. Also, retrofit comes with gson, which is nice, tho.
  1. Test are written in Espresso. You can find then in test folder.

## Personal

1. I took almost 10 days in total. Coding time about 12 hours.
1. I am terrible in UI stuff. I did not use fancy material design classes to implement my UI, just did really basic.
