## Known

1. This will only work while my personal token to the json file is valid. It must be changed to the actual file. 
1. There is no secure layer implemented. It would be good to sign in first. I did a class called WebSession that could handle it, but once again it is not implemented.
1. I am terrible in UI stuff. I did not use fancy material design classes to implement my UI, just did really basic.
